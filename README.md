The SPELL Framework
==============

The **SPELL Framework** is a framework that analysis automatically software source code. This framework encloses three separate tools that representate the methodology follow in the :green_book: [dissertation](https://github.com/tcarcao/spellframework/blob/master/spell.pdf) also present in this repo. 

This methodology is divided in the three steps that follow:

1. Instrumentation, Compilation & Test suite execution -- (C programs)
2. Results Treatment -- (Program language independent)
3. Energy Analysis -- (Program language independent)

In this repository there is the source code of this framework and also the runnables.

Each tool is separeted in a folder, and can be executed as a stand alone.

This framework has been developed in tested in a specific environment. There are no garanties that it will function in other conditions.
The environment settings are listed above:

* Java 8
* Perl 5.0
* Intel Power Gadget Tool 2.0
* Mac OSX 10.9
* Intel Haswell

This work was developed during my masters Thesis in [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt) and my lab is the [Green Software Lab @ PT](http://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/).
